# GitHub-Follow-Bot

A bot done with python to follow and unfollow users in GitHub.


## Releases:

###There is 2 releases the Selenium and the GithubAPI
- The Selenium release it faster then the GitHubAPI but it uses more CPU and it's unsafe
- The GithubAPI release it can be run in the background and it's slow but safe 


## Why I did this?

Somewhere, I read:
- One in ten people you follow will follow you back.
- One in hundred people you follow will star your repos.
- One in thousand people you follow will fork your repos.

Might be true, might be not 🤷‍.
